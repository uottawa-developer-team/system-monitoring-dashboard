# Sprint 1 Progress Report

## Introduction
**Overview of Sprint 1:**
- Sprint 1 began on July 1st and concluded on July 13th.
  The focus of Sprint 1 was to establish consistent development environments for both lead developpers, and make preliminary BASH scripts to gather
  core data to be used and charted in later phases. These goals were achieved, and four scripts were written to gather RAM usage, network activity,
  available and total disk space, and CPU usage

**Objectives and Goals:**
- Establish development environments
- Write BASH scripts for data logging
- Establish documentation format

## Completed Work
### Task 1: [Establish development evironments]
**Description and Outcomes:**
- Both developers needed consistent development environments, in particular LINUX / WSL. This process was successful.

### Task 2: [Write BASH scripts for data logging]
**Description and Outcomes:**
- Four scripts needed to be written - one for collecting CPU usage, one for disk space, one for RAM usage, and one for network devices and
  primary network device activity.
- The scripts were written for compatibility with LINUX systems. They will need compatibility improvements for cross-platform use.

### Task 3: [Establish documentation format]
**Description and Outcomes:**
- Documentation progress and retroactive change policy needed to be determined.
- It was established that the initial documentation will persist as-is, and each sprint will be documented separately. A final documentation file will be
  utilized as the user guide once the project is complete.
